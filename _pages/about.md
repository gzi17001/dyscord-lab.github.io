The **dyscord lab** explores the
**dy**namics of
**s**ocial
**c**ommunication and inter-**or**ganism
**d**ependencies.
We investigate social interaction in a dynamical and ecological framework using
data-rich methods. We strive to conduct our science in a way that broadens
access to and resources for these approaches. We do this by adopting open-science
practices, by creating open-access resources, and by contributing to educational
efforts.

## About us

At its core, our lab is built on a culture of respect and openness. We value
each member's contributions to the lab, whatever their role is.
We appreciate the effort, time, and unique perspectives that each member brings.
We actively strive to cultivate a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion
to make sure that everyone feels welcome in our scientific endeavors. We
expect each person to act with personal, scientific, and academic integrity,
and we expect each person to treat others with respect and dignity.

We are located in the
[University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/)’s
[Department of Psychological Sciences](https://psych.uconn.edu/), specifically
within the
[Perception, Action, Cognition division](https://psych.uconn.edu/perception-action-cognition-division/).
We are connected to
the multidepartmental [Center for the Ecological Study of Perception and Action](https://cespa.uconn.edu/)
and the cross-divisional [Social-Ecological and Environmental Lab](https://seelab.socialpsych.uconn.edu/).
[We acknowledge](https://nacp.uconn.edu/land-acknowledgement/) that the land on
which we gather is the territory of the Mohegan, Mashantucket Pequot, Eastern
Pequot, Schaghticoke, Golden Hill Paugussett, Nipmuc, and Lenape Peoples, who
have stewarded this land throughout the generations.

## Joining the lab

We're looking for interested undergraduate students to join our lab as research
assistants! If the possibility of being a part of our community interests you,
[please fill out this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScxCpwVgjQav5GtNbVnUdEvgmX7sY3qWOaNJ2HH4jndZF4Grw/viewform?usp=sf_link).
Someone from our lab will reach out to you to follow up within a week (although
it might be longer if you fill this out during a break).
